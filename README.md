     Project Title: Expression Classification from Facial Images
     Project Summary
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify facial expressions in images. By analyzing human emotions, it has broad applications, including sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and mental health monitoring. We used the FER2013 dataset, comprising seven different emotion labels. Our model, based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), was trained and evaluated on this dataset. We conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize its performance, and the results were visualized with sample predictions.
